#About Airs

We AIRS are conducting various lectures, workshops and mentorship programs to help students realize their projects. The mission of the society is to expose students to challenges and new technologies in the field of electronics and thus to nurture and develop their skills set in this arena.

 Aim at bringing out the "technological best" in students.

 The chief aim of the club is to bring the students out of their rooms and to expose them to the challenges awaiting them in the field of circuit designing, hardware analysis and programming.

 Aim at providing students with the basic knowledge of electronics but also help them to use the basic concepts to come up with something constructive and useful for the society.

 To conduct lecture series, workshops and also assign projects to students.

 Aim to find hidden talent and to utilize them for teaching learning process.

#AIRS Projects

The far reaching technical advancements and career options in the industry always need knowledgeable, technically sound, creative and amazingly quick problem solving skilled engineers. Therefore, focusing of this aspects we are trying everyday to make innovative projects in different domains. By this we aim to make transformation of Theoretical Knowledge into its applications.

Project work gives engineering solutions to the outcome of existing systems.We are trying to select projects that are related to the society oriented applications like heartbeat detector, LPG gas leakage detector and many more.

Project work enables one to conduct oneself in a professional manner by analyzing, managing, evaluating the project related matters. Project implementation always makes use of the latest and more advanced technologies for controlling equipments and devices. Therefore, we believe in learning as well as teaching our fellow colleague.
